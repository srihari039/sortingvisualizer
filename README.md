## Layout

![layout](styles/images/layout.png)

* There will be the sorting options(buttons) on the top panel of the window.
  
* Buttons for the manipulation of array will be on the left side of the window.

## Side Panel

![layout](styles/images/while-running.png)

* Initially the new Array Button will be available to use.
  
* As soon as the user hits one of the sorting option, the new array button gets disabled and gets back into action as soon as the sorting is completed.
  
* The same is the case with the array size input.
  
* The input for sorting speed remains intact, i.e the user can interact with it at any point of time and the animation responds accordingly.

## While Running

![layout](styles/images/side-panel.png)

* We can see the blob comming from the left of window to assist what's happening with algorithm.
  
* The colours changing in the bars can be clearly observed and with the blob on the left, one can easily get what's going on!.
